                <h1>Welcome to Indian Army Website</h1>
                <p>The distinguished history of Indian Army dates back more than ten thousand years. The two grand epics
                    of ‘Ramayana’ and
                    ‘Mahabharata’ constitute the fundamental framework around which the edifice of Indian Army is built.
                    The massive war
                    ‘Mahabharata’, fought at Kurukshetra in north-central India, has left indelible imprints on the
                    Indian psyche. Fought
                    relentlessly for eighteen days in the quest of peace, the force level described in the Epic states
                    18 ‘Akshaunis’, seven
                    with the ‘Pandavas’ and eleven with the ‘Kauravas’, amounting to nearly 400,000 assorted troops
                    fighting on chariots,
                    horses, elephants and foot soldiers.

                    Though innumerable wars have been fought thereafter, most were in quest of universal peace and
                    ‘dharma’. Recourse to
                    arms was only taken when peace was threatened. In fact the word 'peace' forms the very core of
                    Indian philosophy, which
                    can most aptly be traced to one of India's ancient scriptures known as the ‘Yajurveda’. It is stated
                    in verse, the
                    English translation of which reads - “May the sky be peaceful; may the atmosphere be peaceful; may
                    the earth be
                    peaceful; may eternal peace cometh upon us.</p>

                <h2>Section 2</h2>
                <p>The archaeological history of India dates back to more than 2500 BC, when an urbanised civilisation
                    known as the Indus
                    Valley Civilisation flourished along the banks of River Indus, in the alluvial north - western
                    plains. Similar findings
                    like the coastal cities of Lothal and Dwarka came to light more recently along the coast of Gujarat.
                    However, the Indus
                    Valley Civilisation’s two urban centres at Mohenjodaro and Harappa gradually declined in the second
                    millennium BC, and
                    almost completely disintegrated around 1500 BC due to ecological reasons like drying up of rivers
                    and drought. The
                    coastal cities disintegrated due to massive floods.

                    Due to the gradual extinction of such civilizations, the north-western invasion route through the
                    Hindu Kush Mountains
                    remained unguarded for centuries, and gradually many people and tribes managed to cross over for
                    better economic
                    prospects. With many recent landmark findings refuting the invasion of Asian-European people, or the
                    Aryans, into the
                    Indian sub continent en masse, the military history of India dates back to 6th century BC,
                    encompassing the period when
                    some of the more belligerent forces like the Persians, Greeks, the Turks, Huns, Mongols and so on
                    crossed over into the
                    more fertile and alluvial plains of India from the north-western route.

                    Though scanty details are available of the early conflicts between the invading forces, evidence
                    shows that some of the
                    invaders did manage to slowly overrun western India and consolidated their hold along the Indo -
                    Gangetic plains, and in
                    the process subdued numerous native tribal kingdoms through pitched battles. Their advance further
                    south was generally
                    halted by the jungle covered Vindhya Mountains. Those apart, certain areas along the western coast
                    and the Deccan
                    plateau were hilly and sparse – unsuitable for the movements of considerable bodies of people.
                    However, this vast area
                    also lent itself favourably to resistance against invasion by loose fighting warriors, such as the
                    Marathas who
                    subsequently became a force to reckon with. The other major pre-condition of war in India was and
                    continues to be the
                    climate. Monsoon rains between June and September rendered movement of armies virtually impossible.
                    The best season for
                    campaigning was always October and November, when the crops were ripe, the herbage green and it was
                    possible to live off
                    the country.

                <h2>Section 3</h2>
                <p>The armies of the native tribes were made up mostly of foot-soldiers, later come to be known as the
                    infantry. The bow
                    and arrow were their principal weapons. Cavalry was non-existent as horses were scare. Around 537 BC
                    Cyrus of Persia
                    reached the region of modern Peshawar, and his successor Darius conquered part of north-western
                    Punjab. Their invasions
                    brought home to the Indians the importance and utility of cavalry, however Indian climate conditions
                    were not conducive
                    for the breeding of good horses, and therefore reserved for pulling the war chariots of kings and
                    nobles. So the
                    infantry continued to be relied upon as the decisive weapon of war. Warriors were the most honoured
                    and leading classes
                    of society.

                    Wars usually had limited objectives and were fought for the most part with far less savagery than
                    elsewhere in the
                    world. Rarely did the locals indulge in mass slaughter after a victory. Such chivalrous and rather
                    ritualistic conduct
                    of war made conquest by less punctilious invaders rather easy.

                    The first definitely recorded fact in Indian political history is the invasion by the Greeks under
                    Alexander the Great
                    during 327-6 BC. After crossing the Hindu Kush Mountains, Alexander captured the city of Taxila and
                    defeated India’s
                    King Porus at the battle of the Jhelum, or Hydespes as referred to by the Greeks. Chariots were
                    still a considerable
                    force in the army under Porus, these being made of wooden struts bound together with leather thongs,
                    and drawn by two
                    horses. Each chariot had a driver and a bowman. Some heavier chariots had four horses and carried
                    upto six men, of whom
                    two were shield-bearers, two were archers and two were drivers who also functioned as javelin
                    throwers during the
                    battle. The chariots at Jhelum did not fare well, getting stuck in the mud. King Porus himself had
                    come to battle
                    mounted on an elephant. Invaders like Alexander, who came to conquer India, appreciated and adopted
                    local military
                    customs, and even its civilian culture. New kingdoms and a few alliances were soon formed, but these
                    proved to be
                    woefully inadequate against yet more foreign invaders.

                    Wars were most prominent in the politics and literature of ancient India. Occasionally great kings
                    like Chandragupta
                    Maurya succeeded in subduing and unifying most of the people of India. Manuals of statecraft such as
                    the ‘Arthashastra’
                    of Kautilya, relating to the period 300 BC to 100 AD, indicate the prominence of war as an
                    instrument of state policy.
                    The ‘Arthashastra’ is one of the most significant documents of military history ever to be written.
                    It is an exhaustive
                    treatise on the early concepts of government, law and war. Its military section cover the
                    composition and structure of
                    armies, the role and function of the arms and services, training concepts and methods, duties of
                    various military
                    functionaries, strategic and tactical concepts, defensive fortifications, leadership and management
                    of large armies.

                    Under Chandragupta Maurya, Central Asian invaders like the Huns, who in their days had razed and
                    plundered a major
                    portion of the known civilized world, were to stand checked. Chandragupta defeated the remnants of
                    the Macedonians and
                    established the first great dynasty, the Mauryan Empire. Chandragupta added to the extent of the
                    empire, and he was the
                    first to maintain a large, permanent standing army. Bindhusara expanded the empire and Ashoka
                    brought the Mauryan Empire
                    to the height of its power and glory. The Kalinga war proved to be the turning point of his life. It
                    was after this,
                    Ashoka renounced the sword and took to Buddhism, which he spread far and wide through his disciples
                    and emissaries.</p>
